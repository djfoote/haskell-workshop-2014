haskell-workshop-2014
=====================

Code and walkthrough for the Fall 2014 Hackers @ Berkeley Haskell workshop

Prerequisites
=============
This workshop assumes understanding of functional programming at the level of CS 61A. If you have not taken or are currently taking 61A, it may be hard to follow along. 

You should have already installed the Haskell Platform. If you have not, please do so by following the instructions at http://www.haskell.org/platform/

What You Will Learn
===================
I'm not going to make you a Rockstar Haskell Ninja Jedi in two hours. This workshop is, as I said, geared specifically toward those who have taken 61A but have never seen Haskell before. The implications of this are twofold:

1. Much of the focus of most introductory Haskell material is on things that you are already well familiar with, in particular higher order functions and recursion. We don't have to bother learning the ideas governing these concepts from the ground up, so we will be able to get into more unique aspects of the language and solving problems in a purely functional paradigm fairly quickly. 

2. As a consequence of that point, you're not going to have a lot of practice with the Haskell syntax by the time we do get into more interesting things. For that reason, the code we go through may be somewhat hard to follow the first time. If there's an overwhelming response of dissatisfaction with this, I'll slow down at the cost of not getting to everything planned. 

My goal then is not that you can sit down after the workshop and come up with all of this code again without any reference, but that, should you be intrigued enough to try to continue learning Haskell, you have a couple starting points for things to hack on that are both familiar and sufficiently interesting. You can look up the syntax as you need to (and believe me, it takes quite a while to internalize). 

The Interpreter
===============
GHCi is the Haskell interpreter that comes packaged with the Platform. Open it up in your terminal by typing `ghci`.
